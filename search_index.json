It's in bite-sized Q&A format, covering a variety of things from how to deal with smelly co-workers to what to do if you throw up during a job interview to how you as a manager can coach people away from unrealistic goals. A good reference work that you can read and learn from in small doses. Even if you don't hit all of these exact situations (really, how many people have to deal with a bonkerballs co-worker putting curses on people?), Green's overall attitude of respect for everyone and honest conversation is a great example for us all. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy).\nThe Advantage: Lencioni is pretty well known for his business fables (FIVE DYSFUNCTIONS OF A TEAM et al). This is his non-fable book, a synthesis of his work and the points he made in those other books to take an overall look at organizational health and its benefits. He walks through what he's found necessary about high-performing organizations, from leadership alignment to good hiring practices to which executive meetings are necessary and how they should be structured. I found the discussion of core values (and the other types) very useful, among other things. There is a fair amount of advertising for his consulting group sprinkled throughout, but it's more \"we could help you with this\" than \"if you want the real secrets pay us\" so it wasn't annoying; between the book and the handouts on the book's website, they appear to be giving away their whole system for free. Recommended. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nThe Best Team Wins: Heard the author on a podcast & ordered the book. I'm glad I did, even though a lot of the motivational techniques in here leave me cold. I'm an aging baby-boomer and so a lot of the things the authors have to say about those born later leave me confused. But they also match up with some of what I'm seeing at work. There is plenty of concrete advice here for motivating individual contributors and entire teams, including a long list (101!) of techniques to try. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nBrave New Work: Dignan digs into what some organizations are doing to change the rules, then walks through a set of chapters on evaluating \"the operating system\" of your own organization and possible alternatives (this is the strongest part of the book in my opinion) and closes with a section on how to run a change process. Bear in mind that this is his own work, which means it's based on actual experiences in helping places change. I've got a bunch of sticky notes to review for the future as our company grows; the sections that ask penetrating questions on topics like strategy and resources, together with the guidance on what it means to be \"people positive\" and \"complexity conscious\" seem quite valuable to me. The main question in my mind is whether these good, innovative companies are destined to be trampled by the Facebooks and Ubers of the world, but we won't know that for another decade or more. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nThe Checklist Manifesto\nThe Coaching Habit: Say Less, Ask More & Change the Way You Lead Forever: Maybe if you're already a superb manager you don't need to read this. But if you're relatively new to management, have zero time, and want to improve your one-on-one game, it's an easy read with a good payoff. I suspect most people won't stick with Stanier's \"here are the seven questions that guarantee coaching success\" approach, but the overall notion of how to coach through questions is well worth getting into your head. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nCrucial Conversations: Skills for getting past conversations that have turned into battles. The authors bring out just a few critical skills that are designed to get things back to the point where everyone involved is contributing to a pool of meaning. They won't always work, but they do help. The main challenge I have is to remember this stuff in the heat of the moment, but as they point out, anything that moves you in the right direction is worth doing. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nThe Daily Drucker: It took me a year to read this one, but after all, that's what it's intended to take. Bite-sized (no more than a page or two) chunks from Drucker's decades of writing on management, together with action points that can be used as springboards for thought. A lot of these didn't apply to my own circumstances as I read them, but enough things did, in fields from time management to marketing, to make it worth my while to exercise my brain on this book daily. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nDeep Work: I'm pretty conflicted about this one. On the one hand, I do think the concept of deep work is valuable. The idea that some things require focus & concentration to achieve, and that you won't hit that focus and concentration by accident, is useful. But on the other hand, Newport's arguments in favor of it are largely a mix of anecdote, poorly-justified pop science of the Ted Talk variety, and fallacious logic. When he gets around to arguing that social media is worth quitting, though he himself has never been deeply involved, the whole takes on the flavor of a virgin producing straw-man arguments to justify avoiding sex. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nDynamic Reteaming: This one is currently in not-quite-final form at Leanpub, but although it still needs a tiny bit of copy editing, it's practically done. Helfand draws on her own experience in several growing tech companies, as well as interviews with other coaches, managers, and non-managers, to identify some patterns of change on teams. There's thinking here about team lifecycles, antipatterns to avoid, onboarding people to new teams, among other things. I especially liked the stories of companies that have had success allowing people to choose their own teams, either as part of a major reorganization or on a regular basis. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nThe Effective Executive\nThe Effective Hiring Manager: I grabbed this one as soon as it was available and I'm glad I did; a lot of Horstman's advice will inform my future hiring process. That said, many many people are going to hate this book because it is bluntly about doing a good job of hiring based on job fit and merit. If you're one of the people who feels diversity & inclusion must be considered when hiring, well, those words aren't even in the index. There are also other times that you'll want to bring someone in based on factors other than proven ability in job skills (hiring interns, for example). But if you want a step-by-step process that leads to efficient decision-making and removes dependence on \"gut feeling\", and that goes from reading CVs straight through onboarding, you've come to the right place. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nThe Effective Manager\nAn Elegant Puzzle: Will has been a senior leader at several large software companies including Stripe, Digg, and Uber. This is his collection of \"how to do it\" recipes for success. I suspect it will have the strongest appeal to leaders who have come up from the software development ranks and who find people messy and uncomfortable. There is some material here on areas like hiring and culture, but the book is at its strongest when talking about things like the perfect n-step process to cold-recruit people based on their LinkedIn profiles, or how to size and reorganize teams. If you believe that management can be reduced to the same sort of science as databases, this is the book for you. I'll keep it on the shelf, but I don't think it'll be my go-to. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nFIRE: How Fast, Inexpensive, Restrained, and Elegant Methods Ignite Innovation: An argument that better work comes out of projects that are deliberately \"fast, inexpensive, restrained, and elegant\". The author comes out of the engineering & military communities, where he's certainly had lots of opportunity to observe projects that miss all of those targets, soak up money, and deliver nothing of value. But the principles apply in software development as well. Constraining things can have a wonderful focusing effect. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nThe Five Dysfunctions of a Team:As it says on the tin, this is a \"fable\" and as such it can come out however the author wants. So, there's a happy ending, where the new CEO manages to build a high-performing team. Nobody wants to read a fable about the teams that crater. I'm not convinced Lencioni has identified THE way to high-performing teams, but a lot of this stuff strikes me as A way, and the connection between vulnerability and trust is, I think, more important than many small-team leaders give it credit for. So for reinforcement of that point, as well as for being a good story told well, I give it a five. I wonder, though, how many leaders and prospective leaders read this one through the warm glow of \"the new CEO is so sharp, and her direct reports are such bozos...why that's exactly the way it is here!\" Not Lencioni's point at all, but I'll bet it helps with sales. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nFlight of the Buffalo: I read this one at roughly the same time as Pflaeging's ORGANIZE FOR COMPLEXITY, and it wasn't long before I got an eerie \"separated at birth\" notion. Those who think this agile decentralized stuff is all new might want to dip into FLIGHT OF THE BUFFALO, now 25 years old. The central theme: that you get better leadership by helping your people grow into a flock of self-organizing geese than you do by being the lead buffalo who does everything (and thereby becomes the indispensable bottleneck to everything in the organization). An easy, though somewhat long read, it teaches a series of lessons about why and how a good leader will let go, and how to challenge your employees to succeed by delivering great performance for customers. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nGet Smart!: How to Think, Decide, Act, and Get Better Results in Everything You Do \nThe Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement: This one gets super reviews but I'm at best lukewarm about it. It's an early example of the \"teach business principles through a novel\" genre. In this case, the bumbling plant manager gets whacked over the head by his Israeli physicist friend until he figures out that flow through his plant is more important that keeping everyone busy. You'd think that the piles of inventory choking things off would have been a clue. There are things to learn here, but they could be taught in half the size, without the bad romantic subplot or the amazingly bad portrayal of Boy Scouts. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nGrinding It Out\nHow F*cked Up Is Your Management?: You can read the title two ways: \"how fucked up are these idiots I report to\" or \"how fucked up is my own management style\". I think the second reading is much more productive. From the editors of The Co-Pour (https://mfbt.ca/), (and a lot of the content started there), this book takes a hard look at some common management and geek ideas and rethinks them. Think you're doing enough for diversity? Think your unlimited vacation policy is a benefit? Think again. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nHow to be an Inclusive Leader: An excellent guide to those of us trying to navigate the tricky and confusing waters of diversity & inclusion in the workplace. Brown draws on her large experience in the field to provide a framework for thinking about where you are on any particular dimension of diversity, from unaware through aware and active to advocate. She also makes the point very strongly that this is not a simple linear journey, and that you should be prepared to move back and start over more than once. I expect I'll be reading this one again in the future, both for the framework and for the concrete ideas about what to do if you really care about these areas of life. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nHow to be Happy at Work: I ran across this one thanks to the How To Be Awesome At Your Job podcast, and picked up a copy. It's a lot more academic than I had expected: even though this is aimed at a popular audience, McKee has plenty of research background and she pulls in a lot of work she's been involved with in the past, notably on emotional intelligence. There's no magic spell to be happy, of course, but there are techniques that can help in many circumstances, and she makes a nice organized presentation of them. I personally got the most value out of the discussion of hope at work and the value of having friends, even though I'm not one to easily make friends. It's nice to see an empowering set of ideas in one place, though I'm not 100% sure I'll have luck putting them into practice to change things outside myself. But one of the messages here is that changing yourself is a good starting point. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nInfluencing Virtual Teams\nThe Innovator's Hypothesis: \"How cheap experiments are worth more than good ideas\" is the subtitle here, but be warned: if you're in a small startup, you may not have the same definition of \"cheap.\" Schrage has clearly worked with a bunch of big companies, and his idea of a radically streamlined process is to give a team of 5 people 5 days to come up with a portfolio of 5 experiments that take no more than 5 weeks and $5000 each to run. But even if that's too rich for your small-scale blood, the basic notion that actually getting out and DOING things trumps just THINKING about them is worth internalizing. And who knows, you might even pick up some brainstorming ideas that you can apply to your own experimental practice. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nLead Inside the Box: A framework for thinking about leadership in organizations based on a matrix that balances leadership capital invested vs. results obtained. I'm not currently leading a team, but this one was valuable to me from the other side of the table: I did some deep thinking about which of my behaviors at work are causing my boss to invest unwarranted amounts of his leadership capital. I came away resolved to change a few things, and that's about all I can expect of any book. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nLead Like an Ally: A Journey Through Corporate America with Proven Strategies to Facilitate Inclusion: Let me just say this right up front: it took a hell of a long time to get it through my own personal thick skull that \"I only want to reward the best performers and I'm not going to lower my standards in the name of diversity\" is (a) stupid when the rules are designed to make it easier for some people to do their best than others and (b) offensive in that it assumes people who don't look like me are not as good as me. I get it now, though, at least some of the time -- though I still catch myself falling back on comfortable technocratic assumptions that were baked into my thinking back in the days when you could also safely assume that every engineer worth anything also smoked cigarettes. Julie Krantz's new book is an attempt to help leaders of all sorts (but primarily male middle managers, because there are so many of them with problematic behavior) see the problems with this vein of thinking and learn to be more inclusive about their leadership. The book is short and to the point, and leads the leaders through a journey towards a more inclusive style and true allyship using a synthetic story that captures many of the issues women (and other non-majority employees) face in today's workplaces, even many of the ones that pat themselves on the back for their D&I initiatives. Each chapter gives a part of the picture, then analyzes the warning signs (not all of which I saw!) and gives concrete advice on what leaders can do better. Highly recommended for anyone in a leadership position who cares about this stuff, which should be every leader. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nLead Right for Your Company's Type\nLead Yourself First: An excellent book focused on the importance of solitude to leaders - though that could just as well have been cast as \"the importance of finding time to focus.\" While many leaders get that time through being away from everything (running, vacationing, or just closing the office door), others may be able to focus just by a change of setting away from the everyday noise. I'll be chewing on this one for a while, especially as I have fallen deeply into the trap of instant response to everything myself. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nLeaders Eat Last: The basic idea here is simple, clear, and worth knowing: one of the prime jobs of a leader is to encourage a \"Circle of Safety\" in which every employee can do their best. Unfortunately that simple idea isn't up to carrying a 300-page book. There's a great deal of pop biochemistry and potted history and references to things like the Milgram studies (which have since had their moment in the revisionist glare) thrown in, none of which I found especially illuminating. The whole thing strikes me very much like an extended TED talk; you have the feel while listening that you're learning Important Things, but when it's all over, there isn't a whole lot to hang on to. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nThe Leaders Pocket Guide\nMake Your Bed\nThe Making of a Manager: A nice addition to the shelf of management books aimed mostly at the software industry (though certainly some of the techniques here will work in other industries as well). Julie Zhou is currently a VP at Facebook, but she still remembers what it was like to be a new & clueless manager when the company was much smaller. Her target audience is precisely those who have suddenly found themselves in management. The sections on dealing with your first three months are great, and the sections on good meetings, good hiring, and good O3s all stand out as well. Recommended if you're early on the management track, or thinking about heading in that direction & wondering what you're in for. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nA Man for All Markets\nManagement 3.0\nThe Manager's Path: This one traces a typical career progression for software engineers, from individual contributor to mentor and team lead, and then on into successively higher levels of management ending up in the C-suite. The author has made that journey herself, and offers advice based on her own career -- which, you ought to keep in mind, is just one data point, albeit an extended & successful one. This book was most valuable to me in terms of seeing what I didn't want to do in the future. It's worth reading at least as far as you aspire to go, and then skip forward to the last chapter on team culture.  (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nManaging in the Gray\nThe Mom Test: Really helpful tool kit for customer learning conversation (reviewed by Daniel Baily)\nNo Hard Feelings: A leadership book that stepped out of my usual comfort zone and made me think, which is about all I can ask. The authors dig into the uses (and some of the misuses) of emotion at work, arguing that in the modern workplace selective vulnerability is a necessity. I'll likely come back to this one in the future when I hit some situation that I can't quite work through on my own. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nOnce an Eagle: At 1200+ pages, reading this one was a serious commitment - but worth it. The story of Sam Damon, professional soldier from WWI to the VietNam era (and secondarily of Courtney Massengale), it tries to show by example what leadership looks like, as opposed to simply executive ladder-climbing. The portrayal of the necessity of a moral backbone, and care for one's subordinates, is well-done. No wonder they're still reading this one at American's military academies. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nOne Mission: This one was an inspiring read as I think about our company's management structure and how it might get through a round of growing pains. It's a follow-up to Team of Teams, continuing to dig into how lessons from the Special Operations Task Force run by General Stanley McChrystal can be applied to the fast pace of today's business. Fussell makes a case -- I think a convincing one -- that no matter how good your managers are the \"solid-line hierarchy\" of an organization isn't enough to keep up any more. The best managers act as information pumps, collating information as it moves up the organization and sending it back down to other subordinates who need to know. But this is an inherently slow process, and one subject to communications breakdowns as messages get passed multiple times (remember your childhood game of \"telephone.\"). On the other hand, a purely decentralized organization with no managers, a la holocracy, is incapable of large-scale coordination (this is my interpretation, so blame me rather than Fussell if you're a holocracy fan). The solution proposed in this book is to overlay a network of \"dotted-line relationships\" between small teams, recognizing that there are individuals in the organization who are well-connected. That's not new. What is new is seeing management's task as making sure those individuals communicate regularly, that the entire organization is included, and that key connectors are empowered to decide things even at the expense of breaking the organization's rules. There's a lot more here, and I find it all pretty convincing. I'll be recommending this one for a while, I'm sure. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nOnly the Paranoid Survive:  This is Grove's book-length argument that one of the main features of successful upper management is to recognize \"10\" factors that lead to strategic inflection points. Recognize and seize these opportunities, and your company can thrive; miss them at your peril. Overall, it's a pretty good read, and gave me a way to think about my position in my current company (I'm one of the Cassandras). I wish that there was more concrete advice on telling signal from noise, but that's part of the challenge: figuring out which factors matter, and which are immaterial. There's a final chapter on treating your own career as a mini-enterprise which I found pretty uncompelling (it has the feel of something tacked on later to enhance sales), but overall I'm glad I read this. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nThe Optimistic Workplace: There are a bunch of themes intertwined here, on the way to a better workplace. There's an argument that management is better replaced by stewardship; there's a notion that work need not be a soul-sucking trade of time for money; there's evidence that optimism encourages people to perform better. There's also a 90-day plan for stewards who would like to implement these ideas in their own workplaces. While I don't expect to be personally executing on that plan any time soon, I did appreciate the reminders (and evidence) that things improve on many fronts if you act like you're dealing with adults who want to do their best, instead of getting sucked into an endless cycle of politics and distrust at work. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nThe Power of Full Engagement: The central argument here is that if you're busy and focusing all your attention on time management, you're doing it wrong. The authors argue that energy management, specifically various analogs of interval training that allow you to push yourself and then recover, is even more important. The argument is buttressed by a bunch of anecdote and case studies where they were able to successfully turn lives around, though it's unclear to what extent the stories they tell are composites rather than actual individual successes. I generally like the central idea, but I dislike the attempt to put everything into a neat crystalline structure, where what is said about physical energy is perfectly echoed in discussing emotional, mental, and spiritual energy. In my experience, life isn't that pretty. Much of the book also feels like padding or advertisement for their services. But the notion of building rituals to recharge yourself is, I think, an important one, and if you've never stumbled across it on your own that makes this book at least worth skimming. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nPrinciples: I put this one in the category of \"total systems.\" From the inside, Ray Dalio has written down, in a logical and ordered fashion, all the things that he thinks contributed to his own success and that of Bridgewater Associates. Whatever else you say about this, it's objectively true that he's made a boatload of money following this recipe. (The book also contains a biographical section as background, but that's pretty dull and self-congratulatory). His principles run from \"Embrace Reality and Deal With It\" to \"Don't Overlook Governance\" and give a set of tools for life & work. He comes to the conclusion that an idea-based meritocracy is objectively the best way to organize a workplace, and it's very clear that he's used these tools to select people who agree with him to turn Bridgewater into a machine (his word) that functions very well in the world of finance. If you accept his premises, then Dalio's principles explain everything. This I think is the prime characteristic of a total system: from the inside, it is complete, an explanation of the entire world, and you need nothing else. The problem comes when you realize that there are many conflicting total systems out there: Ayn Rand, L. Ron Hubbard, Karl Marx, and Malaclypse The Younger are among others who have produced complete explanations for the world. They can't all be right at the same time. I'm sure there are things in here that will influence me moving forward; some of his ideas on exposing and settling disparate points of view, for example, seem useful (though the description of meetings at Bridgewater, with real-time \"dots\" micro-feedback from participants, is frankly horrifying). But I can't imagine buying into the premises to the point where I'd be happy in an organization run 100% by Dalio's Principles. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nQuality is Free\nRadical Candor\nResilient Management: A short (just over 100 pages) book for new engineering managers. I know many managers who should read this. Unfortunately most of them probably won't, because Lara focuses on all the squishy stuff about building trust and helping your team and getting past the forming and norming stages, rather than on cookbook recipes for managing projects and figuring out velocity. If you're managing people rather than robots, and especially if you're not already familiar with things like the BICEPS model, or the difference between coaching, sponsoring, and mentoring, I can't recommend this one highly enough. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nStart With Why\nStrategic IQ: Wells pulls together a lot of different threads here to try to examine the idea that some firms are better at identifying and executing profitable strategies than others - or, in his language, they have \"high strategic IQ.\" His taxonomy of approaches and pitfalls led me to reflect that I think I've seen every single one of the dysfunctional low IQ behaviors he identifies during my career -- and I'm not sure I've ever worked at a firm that would make his cut for \"high.\" After looking at the idea of strategic intelligence, he discusses ways that firms can improve their structures and their people to compete better. It doesn't all quite come together into a coherent whole for me, but there are plenty of thought-provoking ideas: more than enough to justify buying a copy. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nSwitch: How to Change Things When Change is Hard: A lot of people find this inspirational; I felt it was at best ho-hum. The Heaths provide a reasonable framework for change management, though far from the only possible framework, and if you need to organize your thinking their Rider-Elephant-Path paradigm may be of help. But they are masterful at jumping from particular just-so stories to sweeping principles, and I'm past appreciating that style. One to read once, but probably never again. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nThinking in Bets - I didn't have too high a hope for this one: a book on how to make decisions written by a professional poker player. I expected some variation of \"know your opponents and learn how to bluff.\" Well, I was wrong, and also pleasantly surprised. Annie Duke has a lot of things to say about making better decisions, chiefly by trying to avoid some common mistakes (like depending on hindsight or wishful thinking) with the help of friends. She pulls together everything from John Stuart Mill to the poker table to make these points, and it's an engaging read with a lot to think about in the end. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nThe Toilet Paper Entrepreneur\nTurn the Ship Around!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders - Marquet was a successful captain in a nuclear submarine, which is a rather more high-pressure job than most of us have. He credits his success to pushing decisions down the chain of command as far as possible, and has gone on to a consulting career promoting this \"intent-based leadership\" idea. The book is an easy read, taking you through the (poor) state of morale and performance on the Santa Fe when he took over to the better state he left it in. One nice thing is that he calls out his own missteps and failures, as well as his successes, while boiling his experience down to small chunks. The questions ending each chapter provide a good set of topics for any budding leader to reflect on. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nWhy Leadership Sucks\nYour Oxygen Mask First:  This one is from an executive coach, and largely directed at executives so busy that they need a short, no-nonsense checklist of things that they should be doing (or that they should stop doing).

I'll likely read selected chapters a second time, paying attention to the end-of-chapter exercises as I do so.

The authors come to conclusions like \"lean product development causes less burnout\" and offer their survey-based research as evidence for their conclusions. I desperately want to believe this book, because their conclusions accord with my own prejudices: that lean, agile, and transformational practices contribute to organizational improvement. Unfortunately, I just can't quite close that gap. One of the telling points for me comes in Chapter 15, where the authors say \"We did not collect data from professionals and organizations who were not familiar with things like configuration management, infrastructure-as-code, and continuous integration. By not collecting data on this group, we miss a cohort that are likely performing even worse than our low performers.\" I don't see any evidence for that assumption, or any reason to believe that their self-selected snowball sample is representative enough to tell us anything about the actual impact of various practices on software development. Nonetheless, I'm happy to see this book, because it pushes things in the direction that I'd like to see them go. Whatever my own concerns about methodology, you may be sure I'll be citing this in my attempts to get my own upper management to move to more \"agile\" ways of working, simply because I find them more pleasant.

Even though I'm not the agile coach for the team, I found a lot to think about here - there are many, many retrospective techniques that can be used, and I'll be interested to see us try some of them. This was also the first time in a long time I've thought about release or project retros, instead of just sprint retros. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nCreate Your Successful Agile Project\nExtreme Programming Explained\nFIRE: How Fast, Inexpensive, Restrained, and Elegant Methods Ignite Innovation: An argument that better work comes out of projects that are deliberately \"fast, inexpensive, restrained, and elegant\". The author comes out of the engineering & military communities, where he's certainly had lots of opportunity to observe projects that miss all of those targets, soak up money, and deliver nothing of value. But the principles apply in software development as well. Constraining things can have a wonderful focusing effect. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nLean Software Development\nThe Lean Startup: I ran across this one on my shelf, having completely forgotten I'd picked up a copy and never read it. So I went ahead and did so. I can go along with crediting this book with doing a lot to promote \"lean\" thinking in the context of software startups, which makes it an important current in agile thought. But I couldn't help noticing how many of the companies he cites in this 2011 book have failed to make an actual splash. That's a common failing of business books, of course - but it does make having faith in conclusions a bit harder. On the plus side, the notion of knowing what you're optimizing and experimenting fast is a good and useful one. On the minus side, I suspect we would all have been better off if \"pivot\" as a concept had never been introduced to startup-land. It's not Ries' fault, but that's ended up as shorthand for \"we haven't spent all your money yet, let's try the next stupid idea.\" (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nMaking Work Visible: Subtitled \"Exposing Time Theft to Optimize Work & Flow,\" this is the handbook of kanban practice that you didn't know you needed. Degrandis does a great job of showing why kanban is a practical technique, not just a different set of ceremonies, by motivating it around the need to find (and eliminate) the things that waste time at work. It goes through a lot of different ways to tweak a kanban process for specific purposes, and it's likely that any struggling team will find some immediate relief here. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nThe Openspace Agility Handbook: A little bird (at a previous job) clued me in that this one was getting read in our C-suite. Naturally I had to grab a copy for myself. It's a quick read, and one that proposes a structured course for launching an agile transformation (though much of the structure is concerned with opening up space to avoid existing structures). A few observations: 1) The authors (and developer of OpenSpace Agility) have a bad case of Too Many Proper Nouns With Capital Letters Syndrome. The editor in me wants to make them rewrite to conform to standard rules of English. 2) It was worth the work to get past the T.M.P.N.W.C.L.S issues and engage with the actual material. The path the authors propose for launching a successful agile transformation is at least plausible. 3) Even with this structure, it's all going to come down to people & commitment. It seems pretty clear that the C-suite could launch an empty OpenSpace Agility exercise, collect the results, pat themselves on the back, and go on with business as usual. It would be pretty easy to only extend invitations to participate to \"safe\" employees, i.e., those who will not rock the boat. 4) I suspect the choice of Facilitator is going to be absolutely critical. I think it will need to be someone with respect across the organization and either (a) sufficient political capital to make upper management listen or (b) sufficient IDGAF to ignore upper management. 5) There are some novel ideas here, including inviting even those who are opposed to an agile transformation, and casting the whole process as a game. I don't know if they'll work, but when existing ideas aren't working it seems to me that any new idea is worth trying. 6) Like most agile books directed at a context wider than software development, this one tries to navigate between a \"one size fits all\" prescription and a \"do whatever you want\" description. The touchstone here is whether practices conform to the Agile Manifesto. I'm not convinced this works but I don't have a better idea. 7) \"Emergent leadership\" appears to me to be an idea ripe for abuse by people who are determined to get ahead at the expense of others because they are more outgoing, vocal, or simply loud. I don't see any attention here to encouraging safe space for diverse voices, or to approaches other than the \"marketplace of ideas,\" and that concerns me. 8) There's an assumption here that you bring in an outside coach to help. That smells like a good idea to me, and any organization that's not willing to spend the money on an outside coach may not really be serious about transformation. 9) If the company is really serious about pursuing this path: (a) there will be quick movement and a sense of urgency about starting the process (b) the overall Sponsor will be at the very top level of the company, not a few levels down because \"it's their job\" (c) all parts of the company will be involved, not just engineering (d) travel and other costs will be covered for employees no matter where in the world they live. There are, I think, a lot of paths to agile. This one certainly looks plausible, and its structure may make it less scary to upper management than a complete \"trust us and turn us loose\" approach. I'd be happy to see my employers go down this road. And, if the rumor about them reading this book is true and nothing happens in 30-60 days, I'll be drawing some negative conclusions from that as well. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nOrganize for Complexity: Pflaeging presents his core ideas in this graphic-heavy book (suitable for both right-brained and left-brained readers): that \"management\" is a problem rather than a solution, that leadership is distinct from management, and that there is a difference between \"alpha\" (managed) and \"beta\" (led) organizations. Lots of connections here with things like agile, though mostly implied rather than spelled out. Radical decentralization of decision-making is one of his key themes, and he argues that this can lead to enormous competitive benefits. Best part: there is some prescriptive material on how to think about changing an existing organization into a beta form. Worst part: I think some of his history is a bit glib and misses the complexities of how we got current management structures, though it makes for a good story. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nProject Myopia: Mostly a polemic about trying to mix traditional project management with agile software development. For people stuck in a project mindset, it might be an eye-opener. Briefly, the fixed scope fixed end attitude of traditional projects doesn't mesh well with the notion of delivering highest value first.

It's set up as a set of questions and answers, walking from the basics of the Agile Manifesto through the ceremonies and artifacts of Scrum. I have the same problems with it that I do with most Scrum books, which is that some people seem to mistake form for function, but as a reference it isn't bad.

One way they made it \"pocket\" though was by reducing the type to something like 7 point so it's eyestrain city for us older folks. Things I found interesting; 1. Presenting scrum as a game, with rules and tactics 2. The de-emphasis on \"do it this one way\" in favor of \"here's the principle, there are many practices\" 3. The growing movement towards \"scrum and ... \" as it gets into ever-larger and more diverse organizations. Things that annoyed me: 1. Tiny print 2. The self-congratulatory tone 3. The lack of editing by a native English speaker All in all, it'll be on my shelf, close at hand, as long as I'm in an organization using scrum. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nScrum Mastery: This one has me thinking, which is an excellent recommendation. The author applies experience as a scrum master to identifying behaviors that move scrum masters from \"good\" to \"great.\" When I look around my own company, I don't see a lot of these great behaviors - but I think that's due to lack or organizational support. So then the question is: what can the organization in general, and I in particular, do to help remedy that?

Covers everything from writing good stories, to the different sizes and uses of stories, to a variety of ways to hold workshops for different purposes, all revolving around the continuous conversation between all stakeholders.

Melissa Perri does a great job of explaining why turning into a feature factory is a trap, and how to escape by focusing on real value delivery driven by hypothesis and experiment.

Lots of math interspersed with smartass comments, the latter helpfully collected in an appendix so you don't have to wade through the math. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nJust Enough Software Architecture: A good introduction to the practice of software architecture for any reasonably-seasoned developer. The key takeaway here, and a point that Fairbanks hammers on early and often, is that the amount of modeling you should do is proportional to risk. There are no points for endless reams of documentation that no one ever reads in pursuit of \"completeness.\" He uses mostly (the simpler parts of) UML to demonstrate basic modeling concepts, and provides plenty of standard tools to get started.

But as with many other fields in a small tech company, I end up pinch-hitting in this area. From that point of view, this is an excellent book, focused on balancing a lot of competing factors: predictability vs. uncertainty, multiple stakeholders vs. each other, sales bs. development and so on. There are plenty of useful examples, but more than anything else, this is about having the right mindset and skills to help develop an overall plan, present it, and get buy-in from everyone concerned.

Many designers (and by that term Monteiro and I both include everyone who designs things, including software developers and product managers as well as UI/UX professionals) have become utterly complicit in the unethical practices of the venture-capital fueled giant tech companies, and it's time for this to just stop. If you don't agree with that statement, you might as well not read this book. But if you do agree (and I happen to be on that side of the argument), this is a fairly short summary of the mess we're in, together with a few thoughts on how we might get out of it. I've certainly been guilty of designing bad things in the past - my stint at a combined multi-level marketing/adware company springs quickly to mind - but I've finally reached a point (either in my maturity or my career) where I have deliberately turned my back on that path. At this point I rate working on software that actually makes the world a better place far above squeezing money out of bigger fools. I hope that becomes a trend, though I fear that it will not.

But often we overlook the broad picture. Some subtle, some huge, some you can do something about, and some you just, well, can’t. These all combine to form a sort of internal feedback loop that can lead to lost hours of productivity, bugs, and just all-around frustration. If we can minimize the impact of one or two of these, we can break the cycle and neutralize the rest.\nThe Effective Tech Lead is a 100x Engineer - The Webflow Tech Lead Guide\nTechie to tech lead: My five biggest mistakes - Some advice from a current Head of Technology at ThoughtWorks: \"As a young, ambitious developer with a strong sense of my own talent, I was eager to become a tech lead, and it took less than four years for me to achieve this goal. But over the next two years, the experience and reality of leading a team put me off leadership completely. For several years after, I retreated into the security of the technology, shunning any opportunity to take on more responsibility. Over time, I gained an understanding of the root causes of my mistakes and eventually regained the confidence to accept new leadership opportunities and grow as a leader, and with the right support over the last two years, I've grown as a Head of Technology inside ThoughtWorks. As I have coached and mentored other leads, I’ve learned that some of my mistakes weren't unique to me but are common among technologists who move into leadership.\"\nHow to Grow as an Engineer (Working Remotely) - \"I have over 20 years of experience as an engineer or engineering manager.

If you're one of the people who feels diversity & inclusion must be considered when hiring, well, those words aren't even in the index. There are also other times that you'll want to bring someone in based on factors other than proven ability in job skills (hiring interns, for example). But if you want a step-by-step process that leads to efficient decision-making and removes dependence on \"gut feeling\", and that goes from reading CVs straight through onboarding, you've come to the right place.

But what it will do is give you a great overview of the Health Informatics landscape, its evolution from early days to now, and how FHIR fits in. There are plenty of use cases, and because this is a recent book, links to online tools and information that actually work. The promise of FHIR isn't 100% delivered yet but it's clearly the best bet currently for interchanging information among disparate parts of the medical informatics system. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nPrinciples of Health Interoperability: Snomed CT, Hl7 and Fhir: If there's a better overview of interoperability for healthcare systems I sure haven't found it yet. This is the third edition, newly expanded with coverage of FHIR, but that's only a so-far-minor part of the interoperability landscape. The book starts with a discussion of health informatics and why interoperability is hard - one of the most valuable things here is that nothing is sugar-coated. Healthcare is an incredibly complex field and there are numerous disparate standards for (attempting to) exchange information. After laying down some of the basics (modeling, UML, XML, JSON) it looks briefly at governance and standards development, and then dives into high-level overviews of major standards, including SNOMED CT, HL7, CDA and of course FHIR. You won't be an expert in any of these technologies, but by the time you finish the book you'll have a good grasp of the overall landscape. The book is flawed by too many editing errors, but it's also undeniably essential.

It is an examination of the formal regulations for proving railway equipment safety in the EU, together with the authors' guidance on making the process more agile. Hard-core ISO types will be aghast at the agility here, and all the agile folks I know will look at the pages of required paperwork and extra meetings and pronounce it completely non-agile. But keeping people alive is serious business, and this was a good reminder that \"safety\" is much more advanced in some fields of endeavor than others. I don't see anything wrong with combining ideas from the safety and agile domains, if it helps keep people from being run over by trains. (Review by Mike Gunderloy)\nBeyond Heroes: A Lean Management System for Healthcare: Kim Barnas worked her way up to SVP at ThedaCare, a Wisconsin-based healthcare system, during the time (starting in the mid-nineties) described in this 2016 book. The book itself is an outline of how the system applied lean principles (kaizen, gemba, huddles, standard work, and many more) to the system to improve quality. From the sound of it, this worked well there, and ensured both better outcomes for patients and more satisfaction for providers. Though written from the perspective of moving away from firefighting and into sustainable improvement in the healthcare industry, it explains the tools and ideas clearly enough to be employed much more wisely. I'd be interested to know how the ongoing work is proceeding and whether ThedaCare has pulled back from any of these ideas, but this is a solid contribution to the quality & safety literature. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nBlood, Sweat, & Tears: This one recounts an individual surgeon's journey as his career matures. It also shares a good deal of advice for other (mostly younger) surgeons, with an emphasis on the benefits of empathy and concrete measures that help lead to better outcomes for patients. I was interested to see the thinking about patient safety & healthcare quality from the inside of the system. Lots to think about in this one, especially about how making human connections helps, and big systems sometimes don't. One of the key insights is that simple checklists can help, but the attitude of the entire team towards the checklist has a big impact on whether they do help. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nHigh Reliability Organizations: A Healthcare Handbook for Patient Safety & Quality: An excellent book on HROs, from the point of view of the frontline nursing staff (the publisher is the honor society of nursing, Sigma Theta Tau). Being a collection of chapters from a diverse set of authors, the quality and focus is somewhat uneven; topics range from a broad overview of patient safety and HROs down to individual case studies of applying HRO principles to CAUTI reduction or proper skin graft care in the OR. Overall, this collection does a great job of explaining the basics without a lot of fluff, and it's accessible to anyone in nursing who wants to be a part of the HRO changes that are slowly percolating through healthcare. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nHospitals and Health Systems: What They Are and How They Work: A solid overview of how modern health care is put together, including their history, the ins and outs of funding, and the way that systems are built and managed, along with the organization of care teams. Two caveats keep me from giving this one five stars: 1. It's completely US-centric, which is clear from the marketing and cover copy, but the title might lead some readers to believe they're getting a worldwide overview, which decidedly this is not. 2. The whole book is descriptive right until the last chapter on unions, which is so anti-union that it made my teeth hurt. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nHQ Solutions: Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional: Mainly a study guide for the CPHQ exam, but also a broad overview of what healthcare quality professionals should know (at least, according to the National Association for Healthcare Quality). Some of it suffers from writing-by-committee (\"change models are important, here are eight you should know\" instead of recommending one and perhaps upsetting someone), and some of it is rather superficial (the coverage of data analytics was very light, at least from my point of view as an engineer and software developer). But it's also a great reference on leadership in complex organizations, the major tools and trends in patient safety, performance monitoring and improvement, and the like. If you're involved with leading improvement teams in healthcare, or just want to pass the exam, it's a must-have. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nLeading Healthcare Improvement: A Personal & Organizational Journey: An excellent (and short, about 150 pages) framework for helping an organization and its leaders along the road to better performance and outcomes. The authors combine work from a wide variety of thinkers, notably Deming & Wilber, together with their own years of learning to come up with a view that starts with the individual and then moves out to the organization. Though this is specifically aimed at healthcare professionals, a large proportion applies to any organization trying to improve its reliability. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nManagement Lessons from Mayo Clinic: Inside One of the World's Most Admired Service Organizations: I picked this one up because it lies at the intersection of my interests in management theory in general and healthcare quality in particular, and I was not disappointed. Mayo Clinic is one of the most respected brands around, and it's been one for a long time - and the authors here make the case that this is no accident. There are plenty of smart doctors working at other hospitals, there are plenty of other organizations doing good work - but Mayo has managed to put all the pieces together to create long-lasting excellence. It shouldn't be any huge surprise that this is the result of culture, maybe even more than it is of clinical superiority. With everyone dedicated to the patient first, with a guideline set early on that profit took the back seat, with deliberate training programs for leaders, this organization does most everything right. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nThe Patient Survival Handbook: Increasingly the hospital system sees patients as partners in their own quality of care - but very few people know that before they enter the hospital. This book is a clear guide to some of the things that you can do as a patient, or perhaps even more important as an advocate for a patient, to get the best possible care. They range from simply reminding people to wash their hands, to the difficult subject of avoiding care from a physician who is impaired by drugs. It's an overwhelming amount of information, and not every piece will apply to every hospital stay, but it's worth reading before you get hospitalized so you get a sense of what levels you can pull to have a better chance of a good outcome. Loaded with resources for further research and help as well. (Full disclosure: one of the authors is on the board of my current employer). (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nRethinking Patient Safety: Woodward has been a long-time patient safety advocate in the UK's National Health Service. In this book, she reflects on why, even when we know there's a problem and have many tactics for improving patient safety in particular situations, long-term change and improvement remain elusive. There's no cookbook recipe for fixing everything, but an underlying theme of talking and listening in a \"just culture\" way to help move everyone along to a better place. Reminds me a bit of the \"No silver bullet\" thinking in software development; there's no substitute for doing the work, and no flashy technique that will make actually communicating with people unnecessary. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nSafety Cases and Safety Reports: A book for professionals in the safety industry, ie, those who think about how to make things safer in general, rather than on the level of a particular company or industrial sector. It's written mainly for those who have to work within various regulatory frameworks, and offers good advice on things like figuring out what level of risk is acceptable in a particular operation, or the difference between auditing and assessing reports. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nStill Not Safe: This book is at the intersection of two of my areas of interest: science and technology studies (which was my grad school major), and patient safety (the field of my current job). The co-authors apply the tools of history and sociology to investigate what's happened in the field of patient safety in the US in the past twenty years, since the publication of To Err Is Human. Their conclusion is fairly damning: that the entire patient safety movement has been gradually co-opted by a class of professional medical bureaucrats, more concerned with protecting their own positions and the structure they're embedded in than in seriously addressing the issues. I expect to see this debated in patient safety circles, but it does at the very least provide an explanation of why things have really not gotten much better in the past two decades. Yes, there are areas of healthcare that are safer, and some types of patient harms that have been reduced. But overall, it seems as many people as ever are hurt by hospitals (though it's tough to be sure, since the measurement is so tricky). Wears and Sutcliffe argue strongly that the tools of epedemiology and Taylorism are inadequate to even understand the problem, let alone get a handle on it, and provide evidence that the findings of non-medical safety science researchers have been de-emphasized even as the safety talk within the healthcare system has ramped up. If you don't find this convincing, then you need some other explanation for our lack of progress. I'm not impelled to stop trying to make a difference; however, I am less sure than ever after reading this book that one more app, one more bit of technology, or one more training or conference will make a difference to the lives of actual patients. and in the end, that's what matters. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nTo Err is Human: A year after I started working in the patient safety field, I finally got around to reading one of the books that launched it. This Institute of Medicine lays out the basic issues (too many people harmed by avoidable error) and some ideas for moving forward. They've been implemented in piecemeal fashion in the 20 years since the report, and we've still got quite a ways to go. Definitely this should be complemented with some of the more recent work in the field, because \"fixing the problem\" is not as simple as perhaps it once seemed to be. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nUnderstanding Health Policy: A Clinical Approach: A college-level text that takes a broad survey of quite a few important topics in healthcare. Given the rapidly-increasing costs in the sector, the first four chapters focus on the financial aspects of payment and access, and money continues to be an important subtopic throughout. But the book also covers quality and preventative health issues, the mechanics of long-term care, health care reform and medical ethics. Though it's mostly focused on the US system, there is a valuable chapter comparing the way things are organized in four other nations (Germany, Canada, the UK, and Japan). It concludes with a look at some of the current conflict and perhaps forthcoming changes. This seventh edition dates to 2015, so parts are already a bit obsolete, but it's a valuable overview with plenty of references and a selection of discussion topics. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nUnderstanding Patient Safety: A basic text on all things patient safety from Robert Wachter, an academic physician who has been heavily involved in defining the direction of the movement. This is a wide-ranging survey work, reviewing basic classes of patient safety issues and then walking through a variety of more-or-less mature solutions. There are no silver bullets here, but there is plenty of evidence as to what goes wrong, what works, and what doesn't. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)\nWhy Hospitals Should Fly: The story of a fictional hospital that the author concocted to demonstrate his ideas on how to improve healthcare quality & safety. Some of these (such as checklists and timeouts in the OR, or creating an atmosphere of safety for everyone to speak up) are relatively mainstream. Others (such as empowering nurses and putting patients into shared 5-bed suites) are somewhat less so. It's an interesting way to explore these ideas, but of course in fiction you can make whatever you like work well. An introduction to the field but not I think a substitute for more academic work.
