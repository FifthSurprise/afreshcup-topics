## Health Informatics

* [Health Informatics on FHIR: How Hl7's New API Is Transforming Healthcare](https://www.amazon.com/Health-Informatics-FHIR-Transforming-Healthcare-dp-3319934139/dp/3319934139/): This book won't teach you to develop applications using FHIR; I don't think there's a substitute for the (voluminous) online documentation on HL7's web site for that. But what it _will_ do is give you a great overview of the Health Informatics landscape, its evolution from early days to now, and how FHIR fits in. There are plenty of use cases, and because this is a recent book, links to online tools and information that actually work. The promise of FHIR isn't 100% delivered yet but it's clearly the best bet currently for interchanging information among disparate parts of the medical informatics system. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)
