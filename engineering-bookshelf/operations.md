  * [[https://leanpub.com/testingindevops|A Practical Guide to Testing in Devops]]: An excellent read and reference for any organization concerned with shipping quality software in an evolving devops environment. There are great ideas here on how the role of testers and testing might change, how to socialize those changes (and to get buy-in from across the organization), and many links to articles, case studies, and tools that should get you inspired. Recommended. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)
