# Microservices Books

  * [Building Microservices](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Microservices-Designing-Fine-Grained-Systems/dp/1491950358): A broad overview of Microservice design. As with other broad overviews (such as Susan Fowler's book) it does not get into the weeds with advice for any particular programming language or framework. Rather, you should treat it as a list of things to think about and patterns that have been proven in practice. The field is fairly young, though, so don't assume it's an exhaustive or authoritative list. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)
  * [Programming Models for Distributed Computation](https://github.com/heathermiller/dist-prog-book) - "This is a book about the programming constructs we use to build distributed systems. These range from the small, RPC, futures, actors, to the large; systems built up of these components like MapReduce and Spark. We explore issues and concerns central to distributed systems like consistency, availability, and fault tolerance, from the lens of the programming models and frameworks that the programmer uses to build these systems."
  * [Production-Ready Microservices](https://www.amazon.com/Production-Ready-Microservices-Susan-Fowler/dp/1491965975): There's a fair amount of high-level "mom & apple pie" guidance here on microservices, and a paucity of low-level implementation decisions. To be fair, a book trying to tackle low-level issues in every possible microservices language would be so large as to be unfinishable. The end-of-chapter and end-of-book checklists of things to think about are valuable as a survey of issues to tackle in your own march to a brave new microservices world. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)
  * [The Tao of Microservices](https://www.amazon.com/Tao-Microservices-Richard-Rodger/dp/1617293148): I've read a bunch of microservices books in the last six months, and this is the best one I've found so far. I know that because it makes me want to go back, tear up everything we've done, and start over. Rodger offers a lot of advice down in the weeds about everything from deployment strategies to office politics to monitoring patterns, but the key insights here revolve around how to inspect requirements, decompose them into messages and services, and implement them. Thoroughly recommended. (Reviewed by Mike Gunderloy)
