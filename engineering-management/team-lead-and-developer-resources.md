# Team Lead & Developer Resources

====== Team Lead and Developer Resources ======

Many of these are aimed specifically at team leads, but there are more general articles as well. If you're a lead, you will probably also want to have a look at the [[the_manager_track|Engineering Manager]] resources, particularly if you're leading a large team or multiple teams.

  * [[http://firstround.com/review/making-engineering-team-communication-clearer-faster-better/|Making Engineering Team Communication Clearer, Faster, Better ]] - Patterns for design documents & design reviews "Most engineering teams rely on design documents to describe, scope, and approve projects or features. Those aren’t new in and of themselves (they're just the foundation of what we'll talk about here). Kicking off a project without one would be like a hiker heading into the forest without a map. Engineering teams don’t have that kind of time."
  * [[https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/|What nobody tells you about documentation]] - "There is a secret that needs to be understood in order to write good software documentation: there isn’t one thing called documentation, there are four. They are: tutorials, how-to guides, explanation and technical reference. They represent four different purposes or functions, and require four different approaches to their creation. Understanding the implications of this will help improve most software documentation - often immensely." Blog post from Divio.

The organize work into temporary, build-only teams and are funded with specific benefits projected in a business case. Product-mode instead uses durable, ideate-build-run teams working on a persistent business issue. Product-mode allows teams to reorient quickly, reduces their end-to-end cycle time, and allows validation of actual benefits by using short-cycle iterations while maintaining the architectural integrity of their software to preserve their long-term effectiveness."

This includes sprint planning, the sprint review, the daily scrum, the sprint retrospective and more.

Why would you ever assign blame based on that?"

But often we overlook the broad picture. Some subtle, some huge, some you can do something about, and some you just, well, can’t. These all combine to form a sort of internal feedback loop that can lead to lost hours of productivity, bugs, and just all-around frustration. If we can minimize the impact of one or two of these, we can break the cycle and neutralize the rest.

But over the next two years, the experience and reality of leading a team put me off leadership completely. For several years after, I retreated into the security of the technology, shunning any opportunity to take on more responsibility. Over time, I gained an understanding of the root causes of my mistakes and eventually regained the confidence to accept new leadership opportunities and grow as a leader, and with the right support over the last two years, I've grown as a Head of Technology inside ThoughtWorks. As I have coached and mentored other leads, I’ve learned that some of my mistakes weren't unique to me but are common among technologists who move into leadership."
