## Books

  * [The Effective Hiring Manager](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Hiring-Manager-Mark-Horstman/dp/1119574323) -    I grabbed this one as soon as it was available and I'm glad I did; a lot of Horstman's advice will inform my future hiring process. That said, many many people are going to hate this book because it is bluntly about doing a good job of hiring based on job fit and merit. If you're one of the people who feels diversity & inclusion must be considered when hiring, well, those words aren't even in the index. There are also other times that you'll want to bring someone in based on factors other than proven ability in job skills (hiring interns, for example). But if you want a step-by-step process that leads to efficient decision-making and removes dependence on "gut feeling", and that goes from reading CVs straight through onboarding, you've come to the right place.
