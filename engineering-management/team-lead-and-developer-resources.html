Those aren&#x2019;t new in and of themselves (they&apos;re just the foundation of what we&apos;ll talk about here). Kicking off a project without one would be like a hiker heading into the forest without a map. Engineering teams don&#x2019;t have that kind of time.&quot;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/" target="_blank">What nobody tells you about documentation</a> - &quot;There is a secret that needs to be understood in order to write good software documentation: there isn&#x2019;t one thing called documentation, there are four. They are: tutorials, how-to guides, explanation and technical reference. They represent four different purposes or functions, and require four different approaches to their creation. Understanding the implications of this will help improve most software documentation - often immensely.&quot; Blog post from Divio.</li>

The organize work into temporary, build-only teams and are funded with specific benefits projected in a business case. Product-mode instead uses durable, ideate-build-run teams working on a persistent business issue. Product-mode allows teams to reorient quickly, reduces their end-to-end cycle time, and allows validation of actual benefits by using short-cycle iterations while maintaining the architectural integrity of their software to preserve their long-term effectiveness.&quot;</li>

But often we overlook the broad picture. Some subtle, some huge, some you can do something about, and some you just, well, can&#x2019;t. These all combine to form a sort of internal feedback loop that can lead to lost hours of productivity, bugs, and just all-around frustration. If we can minimize the impact of one or two of these, we can break the cycle and neutralize the rest.</li>

But over the next two years, the experience and reality of leading a team put me off leadership completely. For several years after, I retreated into the security of the technology, shunning any opportunity to take on more responsibility. Over time, I gained an understanding of the root causes of my mistakes and eventually regained the confidence to accept new leadership opportunities and grow as a leader, and with the right support over the last two years, I&apos;ve grown as a Head of Technology inside ThoughtWorks. As I have coached and mentored other leads, I&#x2019;ve learned that some of my mistakes weren&apos;t unique to me but are common among technologists who move into leadership.&quot;</li>
