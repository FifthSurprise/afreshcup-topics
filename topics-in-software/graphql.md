I'm not sure I'm going to flesh out this section, but for my current job I'm needing to track a few resources so this seems as good a place as any.

  * [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) - Generalized GraphQL/REST middleware layer in JS. Potentially useful for combining responses from multiple microservices.
  * [Future-Proofing Backend Services with GraphQL, PostgreSQL and Docker (Part 1)](https://medium.com/@jrryjcksn/future-proofing-backend-services-with-graphql-postgresql-and-docker-part-1-527bd6b1a59a)
  * [Serverless AppSync Component](https://github.com/serverless-components/aws-app-sync) - "The AppSync Serverless Component allows you to easily and quickly deploy GraphQL APIs on AWS, and integrate them with AWS Lambda, DynamoDB & others."
